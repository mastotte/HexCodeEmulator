# Tests
These are the GPU test files for the May 31st checkin.

Per checkins.pdf:
```"input.slug" prints out the controller value to STDOUT on every loop()
call.
• "image.slug" fills the VRAM in setup so that the generated image matches
"image.png".
• "box.slug" tests both your GPU and Controller Input implementations.

You should be able to move and scale the box that appears on the screen.```
